### Project:
Implement a [Distributed Hash Table (DHT)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures/distributed-hash-tables-tvH8H)

### Thoughts:

So I'm thinking we're gonna have a server that the client queries to determine which server has the data that the client wants (based on the key), or it determines which server the <key,value> pairs belongs in (based on the key). Almost like the P2P tracker server that keeps track of the IP addresses.
